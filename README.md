# SMART-Green-Houses
The objective of this project is to design and implement a control system that ensures optimal environmental conditions for indoor farming in greenhouses. The control system will be developed to be robust and reliable, capable of adapting to changing environmental factors and maintaining stability within the greenhouse.
